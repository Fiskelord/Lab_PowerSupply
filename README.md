# Lab_Supply
Switch mode power supply, intended as a lab power supply.<br />
The power supply will be made with a custom Fairchild power module, so unfortunately no datasheet available, but if you want to know more about the module, ask me and we will see if i am allowed to share the information or not.<br />
The project is made with KiCAD, and the libraries are included and imported in the "right way", so you should be able to simply open the project and view/edit it after download.
